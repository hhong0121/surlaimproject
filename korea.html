  <p>
    Korea is a historical country in East Asia; since 1945, it has been divided
    into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the "Democratic
    People's Republic of Korea") and South Korea (officially the "Republic of Korea").
    Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest
    and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the
    Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea).
